While I'm writing this article I'm listening to this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3eiBXiaeieNL6Kvqb8nAFM?si=ea64510f612049d3" target="blank">playlist</a> that I think really cool: 

I'm currently using Windows 11, because I like playing games on my computer, so I invested in a Windows computer to have more support for games.

## Software List

The first software I'm enjoying using is [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases), this software has several shortcut commands and features that help me a lot.

Another software that I use to solve the noise problem with my microphone is [NVIDIA® Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/pt-br/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/), if you have NVIDIA® video cards, I highly recommend it.

Other piece of software that many people may already know, but which is also worth recommending here, is [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/pt-br/download.html) which is used to take prints.


For development I use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=pt-br&gl=BR).
