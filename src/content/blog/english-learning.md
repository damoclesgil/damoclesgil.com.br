## Job Interview

P: Hello How are you?

R: I'm fine and you?

P: Why can't you come?

R: I had a dentist appointment yesterday

P: Talk about you

R:I‚Äôm 27 years old, I‚Äôm live in Goi√¢nia, Brazil, I‚Äôm a senior front-end engineer. I‚Äôve been working in the area for 8 yrs.

I have a strong background in web design, user interface, and user experience. I am passionate about creating engaging, responsive, and accessible web pages.

I‚Äôve worked on various types of projects, such as gyms systems, CRM app, educational websites, payroll systems, and others. I enjoy working in a team and collaborating with other developers, designers, and stakeholders üòÅ.

- You know back-end?
  I had experience in back-end, but my expertise is in front-end. Most of the companies I've worked for have been front-of-house, but I've also done many full-stack projects working freelance, I've created an e-commerce site and a blog.

- Hard Challenge
  The last project was challenging because it had a very specific component input field, Because this field component that my manager requested was different from the ones I had already created, it was supposed to be a component that should have several different reactions, for example he wanted it to save automatically when leaving the field, but it also couldn't save without validating correctly and other various configurations that took me a long time to make. I had to make several adaptations, configure it to accept different types: whether select, checkbox, input text, input number, etc., responsive versions, unit tests, accessibility, viewing and editing versions, icons, and others that I spent a lot of time on, but without affecting the deadline.

- English Level
  My english is not too good, but i'm studying for improve this.
