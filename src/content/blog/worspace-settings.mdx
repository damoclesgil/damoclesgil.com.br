description: My configs using windows 11
---

While I'm writing this article I'm listening to this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3eiBXiaeieNL6Kvqb8nAFM?si=ea64510f612049d3" target="blank">playlist</a> that I think really cool:

I'm currently using Windows 11, because I like playing games on my computer, so I invested in a Windows computer to have more support for games.

## Software List

The first software I'm enjoying using is [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases), this software has several shortcut commands and features that help me a lot.

Another software that I use to solve the noise problem with my microphone is [NVIDIA® Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/pt-br/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/), if you have NVIDIA® video cards, I highly recommend it.

Other piece of software that many people may already know, but which is also worth recommending here, is [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/pt-br/download.html) which is used to take prints.

## Browser

- [ARC](https://arc.net/)

## Coding

- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) - I absolutely love this monospaced font because of all the ligatures.
- [Cursor](https://google.com.br)
- [Runjs](https://runjs.app/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

## VSCODE Extensions

## Terminal

- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=pt-br&gl=BR).
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) - Performance could be better, but I enjoy using this since it's made with JavaScript.
- [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) - A collection of ZSH plugins that you install once and you're ready to go.
- [Fig](http://fig.io/) - Super cool app that adds VSCode-style autocomplete to your existing terminal

## APPs

- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - I never thought something would replace the Adobe suite for me. Figma did.

## Audio
